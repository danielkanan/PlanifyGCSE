# Development Workflow Guidelines

## Build Process

### When NOT to run builds
- **Minor changes**: Do not run `npm run build` after every small edit or change
- **Styling updates**: CSS/Tailwind changes don't require full builds
- **Component modifications**: UI component changes typically don't need builds
- **Text content changes**: Content updates don't require builds

### When to run builds
- **Before deployment**: Only run builds when preparing for production
- **Major structural changes**: When adding new dependencies or changing build configuration
- **Type errors**: When TypeScript compilation errors need verification
- **User explicitly requests**: Only when specifically asked by the user

## Development Best Practices

### Code Changes
1. Make incremental changes without unnecessary builds
2. Use development server (`npm run dev`) for testing changes
3. Only build when absolutely necessary
4. Focus on functionality over premature optimization

### Testing Workflow
1. Use `npm run dev` for development testing
2. Use linting tools for code quality checks
3. Build only when preparing for production deployment
4. Avoid running builds for minor UI/styling adjustments

## Performance Considerations

- Building after every change wastes time and resources
- Development server provides hot reloading for most changes
- Full builds should be reserved for production preparation
- Focus on making changes efficiently without unnecessary compilation steps
